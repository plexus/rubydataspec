A test + benchmark suite for Ruby data structure implementations, in particular persistent data structures.

This has two goals

* agree upon a common interface, so implementations with similar semantics are interchangeable
* provide objective measures regarding performance

See [issues](https://github.com/plexus/rubydataspec/issues) for discussion about standardized interfaces.
